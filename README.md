## Running locally

You will need to have the necessary environment variables setup in your `.env` file.
This should include a key for your openai account. 
    
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY = 
```

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to access your openai credits.

1. Install run: `pnpm i`
2. Make a new `.env` file.
3. Populate the `.env` file with the necessary environment variables.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Running locally with docker

```bash
docker login
docker pull korebhaumik/culinary-craft.
docker run -env-file .env -p 3000:3000 korebhaumik/culinary-craft
```
